## SHlT Feather Wing
Project to fit a temperature, humidity, light, and sound sensor to an Adafruit Feather board.

All other sensor boards include acceleratormeters, pressure sensors, and gyrometers. This board is meant to be a more minimal sensor board, ideal for characterizing a known place. Like a house.

### BaldSense, THLS, SHlT -- what is the name?
When I started the board, I called it the "BaldSense" board. And then I named it THLS which stood for **T**emperature, **H**umidity, **L**ight, and **S**ound.

We did the design and testing as a series of livestreams. Chat suggested the alternative name: "SHlT" but for some reason, insisted that the `L` be lower case... ?

-Temp / Humidity: SHT30-DIS-B2.5KS
-Light: APDS9960
-Sound: MP34DT01TR-M
