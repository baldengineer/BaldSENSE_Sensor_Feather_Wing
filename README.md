## BaldSense Sensor Feather Wing
Project to fit a temperature, humidity, light, and sound sensor to an Adafruit Feather wing form factor.

Minimal environmental sensor board for characterizing a specific location. 

## Sensors Included:
- **Temp / Humidity**: 
    - SHT30-DIS-B2.5KS
- **Light**: 
    - APDS9960
- **Sound (Mic)**: 
    - MP34DT01TR-M
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: 
    - DS3231S

## Status: Work In Progress
I created this project as a livestream project almost 5 years ago. Since then, I have found some issues with the design. And, I have learned how to use KiCad significantly better.

I do not recommending building this design yet.
